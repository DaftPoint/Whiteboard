Point object - a description of a location in the view.
var myPoint = new Point(10, 20); 
console.log(myPoint); // { x: 10, y: 20 }

To create a path item that contains this point as a segment, 
we would need to explicitly use the new Path().
var myPath = new Path();
myPath.add(myPoint);

The Size object describes abstract dimensions in two dimensional space.
It has two properties width and height, representing the width
and height values of the size.
var mySize = new Size();
console.log(mySize); // { width: 0, height: 0 }

The Rectangle object can be described as the combination 
of a Point object and a Size object
var topLeft = new Point(10, 20);
var rectSize = new Size(200, 100);
var rect = new Rectangle(topLeft, rectSize);
var rect = new Rectangle(10, 20, 200, 100);
console.log(rect); // { x: 10, y: 20, width: 200, height: 100 }
